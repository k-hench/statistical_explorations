# Rethinking: Chapter 17

**Horoscopes**



by [Richard McElreath](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/).

Parting words:

> *Thinking generatively-how the data could arise-solves many problems. Many statistical problems cannot be solved with statistics. All variables are measured with error. Conditioning on variables creates as many problems as it solves. There is no inference without assumption, but do not choose your assumptions for the sake of inference. Build complex model one piece at a time. Be critical. Be kind.*
